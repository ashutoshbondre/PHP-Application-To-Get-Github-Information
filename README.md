# PHP-Application-To-Get-Github-Information
This is a project for REALTRUCK  ``https://www.realtruck.com/``.<br />
<br />
I made a PHP application which can take any github username as an argument and provide all the public repositories of that user along with the respective Stargazers it has in a tabular format.

# Installation
1. Download  both RealTruck.php & Table.php files in your local system. <br />
2. Place both of them in the same directory. <br />
# How To Run The Application
1. Open terminal & go to the directory which has the downloaded files. <br />
2. Type ``php RealTruck.php ashutoshbondre asc`` to run the program. <br />
<br />
You can now see all the public repositories of ashutoshbondre (that's me) (insert any other username here) in ascending order of stargazers. <br />

# What Else Can It Do ?
1. Type ``php RealTruck.php --help`` for all the functionalities & usage directions. <br />
